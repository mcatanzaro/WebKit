This directory contains unifdef.h and unifdef.c from:

https://github.com/fanf2/unifdef

With this customization:

-#define endsym(c) (!isalnum((unsigned char)c) && c != '_')
+#define endsym(c) (!isalnum((unsigned char)c) && c != '_' && c != '(' && c != ')')

This change allows us to use parentheses in preprocessor symbols, e.g.
PLATFORM(WPE) or USE(GTK4).

unifdef allows us to avoid keeping a bunch of different copies of our public
headers for each desired build configuration. Instead of having one set of
headers for GTK 3, one set for GTK 4, and another for WPE, we can have just one
set of .h.in templates, use #if guards in the templates, and generate the real
headers using unifdef.

Warning: unifdef does not work inside comments. If part of a comment needs to
differ, you must copy the entirety of the comment.
